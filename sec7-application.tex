\section{Application of the Science Platform inside the Project}\label{application-of-the-science-platform-inside-the-project}

The LSP is not only for use by scientist end users through the Data Access
Centers.  The Platform will be used extensively within the LSST project as well
for a number of purposes.

\subsection{Developer Support}\label{developer-support}

Developers will use the LSP to visualize and analyze the results of code tests,
including both periodic and ad hoc runs using both simulated and real data.
The Integration environment LSP instance will be used to verify and validate
new features and updates to the LSP code, deployment, services, and processes.

\subsection{Commissioning}\label{commissioning}

The Commissioning Team will use the Commissioning Cluster instance of the LSP
to rapidly visualize and analyze images taken for system verification and
validation purposes; to analyze the results of experiments with hardware,
firmware, and software configuration modifications; and to prototype quality
control data products and checks to be incorporated into automated systems.
The Commissioning Cluster instance has direct access to the live Engineering
and Facilities Database, so it can be used to correlate image and image
quality measurement behavior with trends in telemetry.

\subsection{Observatory Operations}\label{observatory-operations}

The LSST Data Facility and Science Operations staff will use the Science
Validation LSP instance to visualize and analyze the data products from the
Alert, Calibration Products, and Data Release Productions to ensure that they
meet science needs.  The Observatory Operations staff will use the
Commissioning Cluster LSP instance to monitor the status of the Observatory
systems and reverify and revalidate the system after modifications or
maintenance.
